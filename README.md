## Examples

There is an example program in the ```programs``` directory.

You can import any script in the internal folder with:

```import internal.scriptname```

Example: ```import internal.extra```

There is a color class in ```internal.extra.colors``` which can be used to display various styles in the command-line.

## Dependencies

This is only usually required on Windows systems.

You can install the requirements with this command:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

You only need to install these requirements if the program fails to launch.
